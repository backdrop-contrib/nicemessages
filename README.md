# Nice messages

The Nice messages popup module changes how Backdrop status, warning and error messages are showing up by giving flexible
stylable nice looking fading little jQuery-popups like on Social networks at hand, provided by the small and fast jQuery
jGrowl plugin. It can be activated globally or partially for certain pages / users and prevents the typical cluttering
caused by error messages getting in the way by moving the grid and layout of a website up and down.

The jQuery jGrowl plugin beats all its competitors because it supports all browsers including older Browsers like IE6
and loads with a very small size of less than 6kb.
